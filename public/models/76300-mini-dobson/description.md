Files are now alright :) ! Enjoy your build.

Everything is M3 with 4.5mm holes for heat-set inserts

Print the primary cage with at least 50% infill for weight

Use little strips of teflon for alt and az

Use 4mm carbon rods - aluminum rods will not work as they will deform

Lubricate focuser with candle wax

 A few notes :
- My rods were cut to 25.5cm, YMMV relatively to your mirror though. It is important to chamfer them (see this pic) :

  - The focuser and eyepiece holder should be printed with a fine resolution, I've found them to be great at 0.12mm, but too tight when using a "strength" profile.

- Be careful about balance, it is thought for a really lightweight eyepiece. I've found the SVbony 15mm SWA to be an okay enough choice to handle the f/4 mirror while being lightweight.

- For collimation I used M3 nylon screws, top and bottom.

- For the secondary holder, I expect three 4x4 cylindrical neodymium magnets, and a steel washer cut in half on the other side. I glued my washer with UV resin, there are conical holes allowing the light to pass through the part to cure the resin for this purpose.

- M3 x 4.5 outer diameter heat-set inserts everywhere

- To mount it, install the rods tensioners then the upper cage, it is easier in this order.

Edit : 25.4mm eyepieces version now available !
