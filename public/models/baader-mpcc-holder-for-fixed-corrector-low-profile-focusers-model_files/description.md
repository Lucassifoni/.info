Holds a Baader MPCC by the external filter thread for fixed usage in a very low profile focuser UTA.

Add three little wood slabs to the Backfocus setting tool so you have a handy driver to adjust backfocus, once.

See the schematic to understand why that kind of holder could be necessary to respect the 55 to 60mm backfocus (depending on your conic constant).
