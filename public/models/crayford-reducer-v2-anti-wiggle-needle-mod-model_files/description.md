The small button has a bit of wobble in the original version. The wobble is reduced to almost zero if you add a common axis to all the pieces. Operation is even smoother !

Adds a through-hole for a smooth axis (like a sewing needle) reducing the wobble of the small button. Just add a sewing needle, point in the small button, through everything, and cut the remaining part at the end of the reducer stack.
