My friend EleusisT has been working on and off for two years now on a [3D printable low-cost 1:10 crayford focuser reducer](https://www.printables.com/model/1116272-v2-crayford-focuser-reducer-110) that's available for free on Printables.com

![](https://media.printables.com/media/prints/1116272/images/8432281_74a6c78d-07a5-44d1-8156-9052140b1859_789911ba-693c-4783-b3c6-51901bf5dbb6/thumbs/inside/1600x1200/jpg/fromv1tov2.webp)

They do not have a website (yet?) and mine seems to be good at SEO for super-niche stuff. So I'm putting this article about it so more people can have access to smooth, reduced focusers.

### Market VS DIY

The problem with commercial 1:10 reducers is that they now cost north of 150€. On one side, the amateur telescope making community is really growing, with younger and younger people using 3D printers to build telescopes. Capable entry-level telescopes have never been so cheap to build, mainly thanks to 3D printing and mass production of optics in China.

This is a bit of an inversion of forces, because for a while, competing on price with commercial offerings was impossible for entry-level stuff. It's only by polishing your own 16-inch or more mirror that you could beat the market, by sinking your own time. Projects like the [Hadley telescope](https://www.printables.com/model/224383-astronomical-telescope-hadley-an-easy-assembly-hig) by Maff and community changed that. The Hadley is cheaper **and** better than commercial options at that price point.

The 1:10 reducer is another take on that matter. For about 1€ of material, you have a smooth focusing motion that does not fear comparison to 100€+ options. Of course, the nature of the mechanical design means there's about 0.1mm of backlash, but this is irrelevant for visual use, the side of astronomy that is now accessible to many.

### The Reducer project

For two years, EleusisT worked on the reducer and we (I and a few friends) printed samples, gave feedback, and tried a few options. Today the project is mature and print-and-go solutions are starting to flourish, based on his project :

- [ST80 plug-and-play focuser reducer](https://www.printables.com/model/1124338-crayford-reducer-by-eleusist-adapted-for-st80-stoc)
- [Crayford reducer V2 adapted for Bresser hexafoc focuser](https://www.printables.com/model/1162137-crayford-reducer-v2-adapted-for-bresser-hexafoc-fo)
- [Crayford reducer adapted to Celestron SCTs](https://www.printables.com/model/1161739-crayford-reducer-adapted-to-celestron-scts)
- [Crayford reducer V2 adapted for Skywatcher "classic" focuser](https://www.printables.com/model/1166495-crayford-reducer-v2-adapted-for-skywatcher-classic)
- [1:10.2 focuser for Hypatia (Hadley telescope 1.25" crayford focuser)](https://www.printables.com/model/1166662-1102-focuser-for-hypatia-hadley-telescope-125-cray)

I strongly encourage you to try it if you have a telescope in that list and a 3D printer. If you have another telescope, a 3D printer, and CAD skills, do not hesitate to design an adapter, and your project will join that list !
