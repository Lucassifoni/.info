Taking inspiration from how the 2" focuser built for K2 (see : [Heavy modifications to the 200mm f/3.52 dob's upper cage.](https://lucassifoni.info/blog/K2-bis/) ), I have drawn a 1.25" crayford focuser for an upcoming ultralight dob build.

It is very simple in terms of BOM and assembly. Three parts need to be printed :
- The main body (in gray)
- The upper arc (in gray)
- The draw tube (in brown)

The needed vitamins / hardware are :

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Design.</th><th>Precisions</th><th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>M3 screw</td>
            <td>Length 20mm </td>
            <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>623zz bearing</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Knitting needle</td>
            <td>dia 3.5mm, smooth</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>M4 screw</td>
            <td>length > 20mm</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Copper strip</td>
            <td>used for eyepiece compression</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>M5 screw</td>
            <td>nylon tipped, knobbed</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Aluminum strip</td>
            <td>58x10x2mm</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>

The files are downloadable here :

- [1.25" crayford STEP, zipped](/pics/focuser/1.25%20CRAYFORD.step.zip)

It handled precisely moving my Hyperion zoom eyepiece (300g), even upside-down (which doesn't occur in practice), while only weighing 100g with my printer settings (3 perimeters, 0.2mm layer height, 30% gyroid infill).

Here's a bad picture of the yellow PETG prototype, awaiting to be re-printed and mounted on a scope :
