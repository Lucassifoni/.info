I'm putting this article today as a bit of praise for my friend Raphaël's work, a 6" f/5 (or 150mm/750mm in non-imperial units) telescope that you can [buy on his 3d printing company website](https://la3emedim.fr/product/smallest/) or [3d print yourself](https://www.printables.com/model/1325533-smallest-telescope-kit-for-150750). I made a few 6" telescopes myself, but his is thought to be easily reproduced, while mine are personal projects.

I actually built one (pictured just above) and other people are currently building or using his model right now. **I allow myself to call it the best**, because to my knowledge it's the only 6" f/5 model with a compact/travel dob form factor online. There are other projects, but either unfinished or showing that the author is lacking actual telescope building knowledge.

This project has a few distinguishable features.

- it collapses to a small enough package
- the models are thought to be entry-level 3d printing difficulty
- the BOM is rather contained (m4 and m3 standard hardware, a few springs, a bit of ballast)
- the balance can be tweaked by the user printing it, allowing to choose between ultralight and eyepiece bearing capacity
- it isn't a first draft but a synthesis of previous scopes by my friend or our group
- it has a regular smooth crayford focuser instead of a clunky noname helical focuser

Is it perfect ? Nothing is. Will it deliver its promise ? Yep. Provided you make or order good quality mirrors and learn to properly collimate a telescope, you will enjoy both the ergonomics and the views.

This summer, a few people were surprised of what you can see in this 6" / 150mm telescope. Used to industrial dobsonians, unproperly ventilated, with below-average mirrors, or unproperly maintained instruments, they never got to see what a good mirror actually is capable of, and how a small mirror is able to punch under a dark sky.*

<p style="font-size: .76em">*The mirror was made by [another friend, Paul, who is now a professional optician](http://gallifrey-optics.fr).</p>

Compact telescopes are enjoyable if you build and balance them properly. Check out this project and enjoy the views :).
