I had the pleasure to go to the 35th edition of the Chaos Communication Congress. Here are some notes of some talks.

# What the fax - Borg - 20h50 27/12

software dev in security industry, interested in faxes
Yaniv Balmas + Eyal Itkin
Alexander Bain, 1846 : transmission of an image on copper wire
All-in-one printers are (still) vulnerable : Multiple connectivity solutions, phone lines, and embedded software.
Fax as a pivot to LAN

- Firmware extraction & analysis (canon-like interfaces?)
- Debugging
- Reco, exploitation?, etc

### Obtaining the firmware

Target :
    OfficeJet (40% of the market), cheapest printer.
    Firmware extraction Ãƒ  la dark\_alex ?
    Main CPU : no specs, no datasheet
    Fax Modem : CSP1040

Exposed JTAG & serial debug interfaces - JTAG is disabled.
A serial terminal is exposed - and doesn't understand anything.

Extracting the firmware (update) from HP's public FTP.
How do you even upgrade a cheap HP's printer firmware ? => You print it (seriously).

The file has the PJL header, it *should* be a valid PrintJob Language.
After decompression (with a method specific to plaintext printjobs), they got the firmware.

The firmware code was compressed with a basic algorithm found before in prior art in the name of Commander Keen

HP Printers contain a whole copy of spidermonkey (Firefox's JS implementation) & make calls to an abandoned (until then) domain fakeurl11234.com
There's a hardware watchdog preventing debugging by rebooting the printer.

Exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability by sending > 2GB to the printer. It took 7 minutes.
Every 2 minutes after debugger injection, the printer crashed.
