You can find ATM-Buddy, my small collection of mobile tools to make telescope mirrors, here : https://lucassifoni.github.io/atm-buddy/

To this day, it does :
 - Spherometer reading to ROC
 - ROC to spherometer reading
 - Sine table angle calculation
 - Hyperbolic conic calculator tuned to the Baader MPCC MkIII corrector

Outputs are tested on my free time and match reality ;-) .
