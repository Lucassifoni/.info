I love the blocky look of this XYZ platform I built in early 2020. Now, more than two years later, I can appreciate my progress in mechanical design. Looking back, the way I placed items on the screenshot, with objects shown in orthographic view at 45Â°, ticks my interest. I like how the small nut-blocks were shown as little characters.

It wasn't very comfortable to use though.
