I filmed the seventh figuring session on the 8" hyperbolic mirror. 

Here is a ronchigram, outside ROC, before working :

We can easily see the central hole and edge turn-up.

After this session, here was the result : global correction has advanced, and the central hole, still visible, has reduced.
The edge turn-up has also reduced a little.
