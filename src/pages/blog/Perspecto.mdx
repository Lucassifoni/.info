Perspectographe.fr was another of my attempts at having a regular publishing platform. It mixed regular posts (text, image, video, code) and pictures automatically fetched from my Flickr feed.
The Elixir backend periodically fetched Flickr & inserted images at the right timestamps, while I could write posts within a markdown editor.

What I liked was the simple markdown editor that allowed to upload and insert pictures. It had a feeling of real simplicity while avoiding having to deal with files and folders.

To this day (Dec 19, 2022), I did not find an editing experience I enjoy as much.
