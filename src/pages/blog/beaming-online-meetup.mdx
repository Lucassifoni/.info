I have had the pleasure to make a small presentation at the Belgian Elixir And erlang Meetup (BEAMing online). The meetup was a calm and warm experience with another talk by Nelson Vides from Erlang Solutions, showing how they secured and revived Prometheus libraries, and people chatting about the projects they were working on (special mention to Raf Lefever and their research work on Scarab/Ex-ESDB).



I presented the architecture and specificities of Alzo, and how I was in the process of leveraging Node.JS (to build Astro-powered static but editable websites) and Java (through JInterface to get access to Apache POI to read/write MS Office documents.)
