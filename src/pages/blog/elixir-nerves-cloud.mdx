My friends from the digital art collective [lab212](https://lab212.org) asked me to work on the software part of their latest art installation, [ombres blanches](https://lab212.org/oeuvres/3:featured/58/Ombres-Blanches). It features an electromagnetic ambiant background sensor developed by [Exem](https://www.exem.fr/), a french environmental research lab.

Based on the level of ambient EM waves, we control a high-pressure industrial pump via pulse-width modulation, re-routing the water flow either to a reservoir or to high-precision nozzles generating a high-quality, realistic cloud.

            <figcaption>The cloud, growing as EM field intensity rises.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

The cloud is controlled by a Nerves app, that gives us a private Liveview control panel to fine-tune the reactivity parameters and persist them.

                    </figure>

We will then make it ready for production use (meaning, able to be shipped as a whole plug-ang-play crate to an exhibition venue) and reveal the technical details after the first show :-) .
