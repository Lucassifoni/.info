I have had the pleasure to be invited by Smartlogic.io to talk with Charles Suggs and Sundi Myint about the remote-controlled telescope project shown at [Code BEAM EU 23](https://lucassifoni.info/blog/prototyping-elixir-telescope-code-beam/).

You can find an episode player here, or go to SmartLogic's website for the podcast + transcript : https://smartlogic.io/podcast/elixir-wizards/s13-e04-terrestrial-telescope-nerves-liveview/

I am thankful for the quality of the questions and discussion with Charles and Sundi. Conversational spontaneous english is harder than presenting and I would have liked to be more precise in the choice of my words, but this was a genuinely interesting experience.
