I committed by mistake a .gitigore file, failing to type the "n" in "ignore". After this, I of course committed the files that I wanted to ignore, but thankfully realized that before pushing.

This made me think that other users could have made the same kind of mistakes.

I generated a few cases of mistypings, both missing keys and QWERTY typos, and searched for a few of those mistakes on github. A few permutations have a lot of public results. I generated about 60 permutations but did not test them all :

```
https://github.com/search?q=path%3A%28%5E%7C%5C%29%5C.<name>%24&type=code

{
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.gitigore": 322,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.bitignore": 3,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.fitignore": 3,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.g8tignore": 0,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.g9tignore": 0,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.gi5ignore": 1,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.gi6ignore": 1,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.gifignore": 1,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.gigignore": 29,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.giignore": 43,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.girignore": 36,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.git8gnore": 1,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.git9gnore": 1,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.gitgnore": 1600,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.gitibnore": 4,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.gitifnore": 7,
    "https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.gitigbore": 2,
    ...
```

Maybe a nice feature for Github would be the detection of those files, followed by a subtle warning ?
