This post will show my log from no toolchain, to `hello world` running from Erlang on an ESP32 SOC, with a mac laptop as the host computer.

I started by installing the ESP toolchain as [instructed by Espressif](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html).

First, install some dependencies with brew :

```
$ brew install cmake ninja dfu-util
```

Then, get the toolchain repository :

```
$ mkdir -p ~/esp
$ cd ~/esp
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
```

Be aware that this represented more than 1 gigabyte on my laptop.

After that, install the relevant toolchain for your specific chip. 
I installed all toolchains to cope with the facts that I have a bunch of different ESPs.

```
$ cd ~/esp/esp-idf
$ ./install.sh all
```

After that, you are invited to export the relevant environment vars by running :

```
$ . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
```

You would think that this can be added to your `profile` or `bashrc`, but this actually takes some time to run and produces output, so this will be run whenever you need to work with the toolchain.

The instructions then invite you to create a sample project, introduce you to the project configuration tool `menuconfig`, and show how to get serial output.

I jumped to [AtomVM's Getting Started With ESP32 guide](https://www.atomvm.net/doc/master/getting-started-guide.html#getting-started-on-the-esp32-platform). Here are the requirements :



- A computer running MacOS or Linux (Windows support is not currently supported);<br/>*okay*
- An ESP32 module with a USB/UART connector (typically part of an ESP32 development board);<br/>*okay*
- A USB cable capable of connecting the ESP32 module or board to your development machine (laptop or PC);<br/>*okay*
- The esptool program, for flashing the AtomVM image and AtomVM programs;<br/>*Hmm, I did not install that specifically ?* *Typing espt\<TAB> shows that it's there :-\)*
- An Erlang/OTP;<br/>*okay !*
- A serial console program, such as minicom or screen, so that you can view console output from your AtomVM application.<br/>*okay, and the ESP toolchain provides one too*
- (recommended) For Erlang programs, rebar3;<br/>*okay*
- (recommended) For Elixir programs, mix, which ships with the Elixir runtime;<br/>*okay*

The getting started guide is actually educational, well-written and thought out, I recommend reading it with attention. It features memory layout diagrams :^).

You are invited to download the latest AtomVM release, at the time of writing, `0.6.0-alpha.1`

Then, you have to flash the device with this image, placing it at the address `0x1000`. You'll have to adapt the port to your specific setup, on my computer and with my specific chip, it showed up as `/dev/cu.usbserial-10`.

```
$ esptool.py \
    --chip auto \
    --port /dev/cu.usbserial-10 --baud 115200 \
    --before default_reset --after hard_reset \
    write_flash -u \
    --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect \
    0x1000 \
    ~/Downloads/AtomVM-esp32-v0.6.0-alpha.1.img
```

It is quite surprising, but with a no-name $3 chip, this procedure worked the very first time. I encourage you to actually read the output of this command as it contains a lot of useful information about your chip :

```
Serial port /dev/cu.usbserial-10
Connecting.....
Detecting chip type... Unsupported detection protocol, switching and trying again...
Connecting.....
Detecting chip type... ESP32
Chip is ESP32-D0WD-V3 (revision v3.1)
Features: WiFi, BT, Dual Core, 240MHz, VRef calibration in efuse, Coding Scheme None
Crystal is 40MHz
MAC: b0:a7:32:28:b4:48
Uploading stub...
Running stub...
Stub running...
Configuring flash size...
Auto-detected Flash size: 4MB
````

After the VM is successfully flashed, follow the guide to the [AtomVM Tooling chapter](https://www.atomvm.net/doc/master/atomvm-tooling.html). 

You are invited to clone the examples repository to start with a simple `Hello World` :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm_examples
$ cd atomvm_examples/erlang/hello_world
```

Then, it's a matter of running `rebar3` with the `packbeam` target, which compiles your application to an `avm` file.

```
$ rebar3 atomvm packbeam
....
===> Compiling hello_world
===> AVM file written to /Users/lucas/atomvm_examples/erlang/hello_world/_build/default/lib/hello_world.avm
```

We then have to flash this file on the ESP :

```
$ rebar3 atomvm esp32_flash --port /dev/cu.usbserial-10 --baud 115200
```

This works too. Opening `minicom`, we are greeted by :

That's quite fantastic :^) . This is the Erlang program that was running :

```
$ cat src/hello_world.erl
```

-module(hello_world).
-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    io:format("Hello World~n").
```

So, we can already guess something here : io seems to sink to the serial output.

Let's switch to an Elixir example :

```
$ cd atomvm_examples/elixir/HelloWorld
```

This time, it uses `Mix` as a build tool. Let's fetch dependencies :

```
$ mix deps.get
```

We then run the mix tasks `atomvm.packbeam` and `atomvm.esp32.flash`, just like the Erlang example earlier :

```
$ mix atomvm.packbeam
$ mix atomvm.esp32.flash --port /dev/cu.usbserial-10 --baud 115200
```

And are greeted with :

(I edited the Elixir file just to illustrate the example.)

That is quite impressive. I invite you to explore the directory of examples, that are quite rich :

```
$ ls
README.md      blinky         esp_nvs        hello_world    ledc_example   spi_example    tcp_client     uart_example   udp_server
arepl_example  deep_sleep     gpio_interrupt i2c_example    read_priv      system_info    tcp_server     udp_client     wifi
```

Combined with `Nerves`, maybe a full-BEAM languages hardware project will become possible in a few years. Shout out to the AtomVM team for enabling that.
