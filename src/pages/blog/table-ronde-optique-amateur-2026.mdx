I'm organizing the first (how hopeful it is to use ordinal numbers!) *Table ronde optique amateur francophone*, an online event for French-speaking amateur opticians and telescope makers. It will take place on March 4-5, 2026 at 7 PM (Paris time), on the Astro-FR Discord server.

The call for presentations is open until February 8, 2026. If you'd like to present a 10 or 20-minute talk, you can submit it through the event website.

**Confirmed speakers so far:**

- Victor Poughon on *Torch Lens Maker*, a Python library for optical systems modeling
- Eric Royer on polishing your own flat mirrors
- Raph (La3emedim.fr) on making the most of a bad quality doublet
- Paul Faÿs-Long on testing methods for very fast and small optical surfaces
- *yours truly* with an alternative "live" build of DFTFringe

The event is free and open to anyone interested in amateur optics, whether you're already churning out optics or just curious.
